            <li>Commercial Vehicle</li>
            <p>A commercial vehicle is any type of motor vehicle used for transporting goods or 
                paying passengers.

                The United States defines a "commercial motor vehicle" as any self-propelled or 
                towed vehicle used on a public highway in interstate commerce to transport 
                passengers or property when the vehicle:
                
                1. has a gross vehicle weight rating of 4,536 kg (10,001 pounds) or more
                2. Is designed or used to transport more than 8 passengers (including the driver) for 
                compensation;
                3. Is designed or used to transport more than 15 passengers, including the driver, not
                 used to transport passengers for compensation;
                4. Is used in transporting material found by the Secretary of Transportation to be
                 hazardous.[1]
                The federal definition though followed closely is meant to accommodate and remain 
                flexible to each state's definitions.
                
                The European Union defines a "commercial motor vehicle" as any motorized road vehicle, 
                that by its type of construction and equipment is designed for, and capable of 
                transporting, whether for payment or not:
                
                1. more than nine persons, including the driver;
                2. goods and "standard fuel tanks". 
                This means the tanks permanently fixed by the manufacturer to all motor vehicles
                 of the same type as the vehicle in question and whose permanent fitting 
                 lets fuel be used directly, both for propulsion and, where appropriate, 
                 to power a refrigeration system. Gas tanks fitted to motor vehicles for 
                 the direct use of diesel as a fuel are considered standard fuel tanks

            <p class="highlight">If we look at Indian economy it is expected that CAGR  will continue to grow by 12-14% in 
                next 4- 5 years which will result in volume growth by 0.5 Lakh in 6T and above vehicle 
                every year.
                Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles (CV) Business sales in the domestic market for FY19 
                (April 2018   March 2019), recorded a growth of 17% with 4.7L units compared to 
                4L units sold during the same period last year. 
                 The M&HCV sales in the domestic market for FY19 (April 2018  March 2019), registered 
                 a growth of 12% at 1.51L units compared to 1.35L units sold last fiscal.
                However the volume is totally upredictable.
                It's because of many reasons say it political or economical.
                Political is presently temporally and however  RBI directives and new taxation 
                policy has made the business scenario very dynamic.

                <li>Life</li>
            <p>Man has made unprecedented outer progress in the last century. Technological and 
                scientific strides in transportation, communications, housing, and infrastructure 
                have transformed the global modern lifestyle at a rapid pace. The primary concerns 
                of the early twentieth century, such as epidemics and infant mortality, have been 
                virtually eradicated in many countries. But is the world a better and happier place 
                to live in?
                Old problems have been replaced by new ones. The industrial revolution has tipped the 
                ecological balance to critical levels; wars are fought in more complex ways; relationships 
                are breaking down rapidly, and violence and aggression persist even within nations that are 
                not at war.
               Progress is the outcome of knowledge generated through our education. And knowledge-sharing
                has never been greater than what we see in today's world, and we appear to have amassed 
                vast amounts of knowledge. On the Internet we can find just about any information 
                from fixing a date to making a bomb.
